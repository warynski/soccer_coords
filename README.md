#### Goal of this app is to utilize soccer players positions data from data.js simultaneously fulfilling following conditions:

###### play/pause button
###### soccer field with moving players
###### each player on the field must be represented as a circle with a player's id inside it
###### passed time and total time counters
###### slider, which changes the current time and players positions on the field

##### This is not about graphic design.
